# bib-open
Search a single BibTeX file and open documents.
The **CLI** is written in **Python3** and relies on a custom field in the BibTeX file called **file**.
Fuzzy search is implemented using the difflib library.

## Requirements
**bib-open** needs the library [python-bibtexparser](https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser "git repository") to be installed.
See the [documentation](https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/) for instructions.
